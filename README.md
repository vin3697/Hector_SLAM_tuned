Implementing the Navigation Stack for the Ohmni presence robot was a robust journey, rooted in foundational resources:

1. ROS Tutorials: Foundational insights from ROS navigation (https://wiki.ros.org/navigation)
2. Husarion Tutorials (https://husarion.com/tutorials/): Essential fundamentals for our project.
3. Robotis Emanual (https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/#overview): Crucial in establishing a solid groundwork for the Navigation Stack.

Deepening our understanding, K. Zheng's ROS Navigation Tuning Guide (https://kaiyuzheng.me/documents/papers/ros_navguide.pdf) served as a pivotal resource. It shed light on the intricate parameters and their vital interactions within the navigation system.

The navigation parameters from the Turtle Bot framework (https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3) were invaluable, significantly expediting our setup efforts.

In our research environment, creating an environment map was facilitated by Hector SLAM. We incorporated changes in software launch files, drawing insights from RPLidar Hector SLAM (https://github.com/NickL77/RPLidar_Hector_SLAM/tree/master).

ðŸ”§ Hardware Setup: Microsoft Kinect RGB-D Camera v1, YD LiDAR X4, and the Ohmni Telepresence Robot were instrumental components in our project's hardware setup.
